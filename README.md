## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` (install pnpm with `npm i -g pnpm`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
